## Uncovering Film Trends Through Exploratory Data Analysis
Student name: Rosalia Wanini

## Overview
With major tech and media companies producing original video content, Microsoft is launching a movie studio to enter the entertainment space. However, with limited in-house expertise in filmmaking, strategic guidance is required to identify profitable genres and production strategies. The goal is to provide actionable insights, after conducting an exploratory data analysis of the data provided, that will inform the studio's initial content strategy and film development roadmap

## Business Problem
**What type of films to create?**

As I prepare to begin reviewing and understanding the data, I put together a preliminary list of questions that could help answer the ultimate question above:

* What genres are currently doing the best at the box office?
* What genres to make?
* What are the most rated movie genres?
* How much does it cost to make each genre of movie?

These questions were prioritized because they allow both exploratory and diagnostic analysis: identifying high-performing genres and understanding the drivers behind them.

## Data Understanding
To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of film performance, I used 5 datasets compiled from industry-leading platforms:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB
* The Numbers

These sources directly address the core analysis questions:

* Genre popularity → from IMDB and TheMovieDB
* Box office success → from Box Office Mojo and The Numbers
* Audience preferences → from Rotten Tomatoes and TheMovieDB
* Production costs by genre → from The Numbers and Box Office Mojo

**The code can be found inside the Microsoft_Movie_Analysis notebook**

## Conclusion
* A higher number of movies produced does not imply higher revenue.
* Music, Musical, Drama, Biography and Adventure are well rated and also highly profitable.
* Drama, Documentary, and Comedy are the storytelling engines of modern cinema.
investing more in the right genre pays off.
* Movie industry is mostly centralized in the USA as most of the top 10 studios with most movies produced since 2010 are of American origin.
* Drama is our Top 1 most produced and we also see it in the top 12 best rated and it’s also listed in the top 12 with the highest return percentage.
* A good budget for each movie produced should be between 4M and 10M
